# :construction_worker: Block-Breaker
A recreation of classic block-breaking games like Arkanoid. A bat at the bottom of the screen is used to bounce a ball of blocks above. These blocks disappear after one or more hits, and there will be three block types of different colors. There will be background music, and sound effects for the ball bouncing, and for the blocks breaking. Once all destructible blocks on the level are gone, you move on to the next level without interruption of the music.
